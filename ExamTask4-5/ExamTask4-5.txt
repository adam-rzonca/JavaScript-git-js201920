[EXAM] Create bouncy simulator. Get board from ExampleInput.js.
X – border, 0 – boards object can travel, 1 – bouncing object.
The program is to show how the object would travel and bounce against the walls.
The program is to end when object comes back to original position. 


[EXAM] Create bouncy simulator. Get board from ExampleInput.js. Y – when bouncing objects enters it move it to random direction other that it came and Y turns into 0,    X – border, 0 – boards object can travel, 1 – bouncing object. The program is to show how the object would travel and bounce against the walls. Bouncing objects starts in any corner. 1 and Y position may vary.
